### Controlled Components - Managing Form Data in React

Controlled components are a vital concept in React that allows developers to manage form data through state. By making form elements controlled, you can synchronize the form inputs with the component's state, ensuring that the UI reflects the current state at all times.

### When to Use It
- **Form Handling**: Use controlled components when you need to handle user input from forms, allowing for immediate feedback and validation.
- **Dynamic Input**: If your form inputs depend on data or user actions (like conditional fields), controlled components help manage this complexity effectively.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ControlledForm = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert('A form was submitted: ' + inputValue);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Input:
        <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleChange} />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default ControlledForm;
```

### Explanation
- **State Management**: Controlled components allow the input state to be managed via React's state, leading to better performance and easier troubleshooting.
- **UI Consistency**: Since React maintains the state of inputs, any changes done in the state are immediately reflected in the UI, ensuring a consistent user experience.

Using controlled components enhances the interactivity of forms in React applications, making them more reactive and easier to maintain.
