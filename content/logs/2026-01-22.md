### State Management - Understanding the Use of React's useState Hook

State management is a fundamental concept in React that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. The `useState` hook is a powerful tool that provides a way to add stateful logic to functional components.

### When to Use It
- **Component Needs to Hold Local State**: Use `useState` when a component requires its own state that affects how it renders.
- **Toggling Values**: It is ideal for scenarios where you need to toggle values like showing/hiding elements, managing forms, or changing styles based on user interactions.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ToggleButton = () => {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

  const handleToggle = () => {
    setIsActive(prevState => !prevState);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleToggle}>
      {isActive ? 'Active' : 'Inactive'}
    </button>
  );
};

export default ToggleButton;
```

### Explanation
- **State Initialization**: The `useState` hook initializes the state variable `isActive` and provides a function `setIsActive` to update it.
- **State Toggle Logic**: The `handleToggle` function updates the state based on the previous state, ensuring that the component correctly toggles between active and inactive.

By leveraging the `useState` hook, developers can implement simple yet effective state management within their React applications, enhancing the user's interactive experience.
