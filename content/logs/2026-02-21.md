### React Hooks - Managing State with useState

React Hooks offer a powerful way to manage state and side effects in functional components. The `useState` hook is one of the most fundamental hooks that allows you to add state to your functional components easily.

### When to Use It
- **When you need to manage local component state**: Use `useState` for any stateful data that should persist across renders within a component.
- **When creating forms**: Use `useState` to manage input values and form submission inside your React components.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State Declaration**: The `useState` hook initializes state variables, in this case, `count`, and provides a function, `setCount`, to update that state.
- **Reactivity**: Updating state with `setCount` triggers a re-render of the component, reflecting the updated state in the UI.

React Hooks like `useState` empower developers to create more modular and functional components, promoting cleaner code and easier maintenance.
