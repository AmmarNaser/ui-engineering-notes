# React Frontend Engineering Note

## Concept: Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components

In React, components can be categorized into controlled and uncontrolled components based on how they manage their state and user input.

- **Controlled Components**: These components derive their state from React's state management. The input form elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` do not maintain their own state. Instead, the value of these components is controlled by React through props.

- **Uncontrolled Components**: These components maintain their internal state. They can still interact with React via refs, but the components themselves control their input states without relying on state management.

## When to Use It

- **Use Controlled Components** when you need to control the input value dynamically, validate inputs, or manage form submissions in a predictable way. It provides a single source of truth and makes it easier to manage state across the application.

- **Use Uncontrolled Components** when you want quick and simple form integration, or you need to avoid excessive re-renders that come with controlled components. They are often suitable when dealing with third-party libraries or when integrating non-React elements.

## Small Example

### Controlled Component Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledInput() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setInputValue(e.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert('Submitted Value: ' + inputValue);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Input Value:
        <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleChange} />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default ControlledInput;
```

### Uncontrolled Component Example

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert('Submitted Value: ' + inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Input Value:
        <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default UncontrolledInput;
```

In summary, understanding the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components helps in building forms that are either tightly coupled with React's state or more loosely coupled, depending on your application's needs.
