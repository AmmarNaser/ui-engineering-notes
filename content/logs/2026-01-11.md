# React Frontend Engineering Note: Custom Hooks

## Concept
Custom Hooks are a powerful feature in React that allows you to encapsulate reusable stateful logic across multiple components. They are JavaScript functions that start with the word “use” and can call other hooks, enabling you to share stateful logic easily without changing the component hierarchy.

## When to Use It
- **Code Reusability**: When you find yourself using the same logic in multiple components, a custom hook can help abstract that logic.
- **Complex Logic Management**: If you have complex state management or side effects, extracting this logic into a custom hook can make your component code cleaner and more focused.
- **Shared Logic**: To share logic across components without relying on higher-order components or render props, custom hooks provide a straightforward solution.

## Small Example

Here's a simple example of a custom hook that handles a counter:

```javascript
// useCounter.js
import { useState } from 'react';

export const useCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  const increment = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1);
  
  return { count, increment, decrement };
};
```

Using the `useCounter` hook in a component:

```javascript
// CounterComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import { useCounter } from './useCounter';

const CounterComponent = () => {
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CounterComponent;
```

## Summary
Custom Hooks provide a clean and efficient way to manage and share stateful logic in your React applications. By encapsulating related functionality, they can significantly enhance code readability and maintainability.
