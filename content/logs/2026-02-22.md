### State Management - Understanding useState in React

The useState hook is a fundamental feature in React that enables functional components to maintain and manage local state. This concept is essential for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### When to Use It
- **Managing Local State**: Use useState when you need to track a piece of state specific to a component, such as form input values.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Utilize useState when you want to trigger a re-render based on user interactions, such as toggling UI elements or handling counters.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State Declaration**: The useState hook declares a state variable `count` along with a function `setCount` to update it.
- **Reactivity**: When the button is clicked, `setCount` updates `count`, which triggers a re-render and updates the displayed count.

In conclusion, the useState hook is a pivotal tool in React for managing component-specific state, making it easier to develop interactive applications.
