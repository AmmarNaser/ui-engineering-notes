### State Management - Understanding React's useState Hook

State management is a fundamental concept in React that allows components to manage and respond to changes in data over time. One of the simplest ways to handle local state in functional components is through the `useState` hook.

### When to Use It
- **Basic Component State**: When you need to manage local state in a functional component, such as form input values or toggle elements.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: When your components require reactivity, such as showing or hiding elements based on user interaction.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State Declaration**: The `useState` hook initializes state with a default value (0 in this case) and returns an array containing the current state and a function to update it.
- **Reactivity**: When the `setCount` function is called, the component re-renders to reflect the new state, ensuring that the UI stays in sync with the underlying data.

The `useState` hook is a powerful feature that enhances the interactivity of your React components, making it a vital tool for modern frontend development.
