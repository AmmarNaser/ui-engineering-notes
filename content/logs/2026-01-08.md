# React Frontend Engineering Note: useEffect Hook

## Concept
The `useEffect` hook is a fundamental part of React's functional component API, allowing developers to perform side effects in their components. It acts similarly to lifecycle methods (like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`) in class components, enabling you to manage tasks such as data fetching, subscriptions, and manual DOM manipulations after the component renders.

## When to Use It
You should use `useEffect` when you need to:
- Perform actions after the component has rendered, such as fetching data or updating the document title.
- Set up subscriptions or timers that need cleanup when the component unmounts or updates.
- Manage local state that depends on props changing.

## Small Example
Here’s a simple example demonstrating `useEffect` to fetch user data when a component mounts:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const UserProfile = ({ userId }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUserData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setUser(data);
      setLoading(false);
    };

    fetchUserData();

    // Optional cleanup function (if needed)
    return () => {
      // Perform cleanup actions here if necessary
    };
  }, [userId]); // Dependency array, runs effect when userId changes

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
```

### Explanation:
- The `useEffect` hook is called with an asynchronous function to fetch user data based on `userId`.
- The second argument is a dependency array that tells React to rerun the effect only when `userId` changes.
- A loading state is managed to display a loading message while the data is fetched. 

Using `useEffect`, you can handle side effects seamlessly while maintaining cleaner and more readable code compared to class components.
