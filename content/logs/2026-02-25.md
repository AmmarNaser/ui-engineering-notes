### React Hooks - Streamlining State Management and Side Effects

React Hooks are functions that let developers use state and other React features in functional components. They simplify component logic, making it easier to manage state, handle side effects, and share functionality between components.

### When to Use It
- **Managing Local State**: Use hooks like `useState` to manage local component state without needing class components.
- **Handling Side Effects**: Use `useEffect` when you need to synchronize with external systems, such as fetching data or updating the DOM directly.

### Example
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        setData(data);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs once after initial render

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  return <div>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
};

export default DataFetcher;
```

### Explanation
- **State Management**: `useState` allows you to add state variables to functional components, facilitating local state management.
- **Effect Handling**: `useEffect` helps manage side effects—such as data fetching—by running code during specific lifecycle phases of the component.

Using hooks not only enhances the readability of components but also aligns with React's functional programming paradigm, promoting cleaner and more reusable code.
