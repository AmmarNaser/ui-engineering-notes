### useEffect - Managing Side Effects in React Components

The `useEffect` hook is an essential feature in React that allows developers to handle side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM, and managing them effectively is critical for building responsive and efficient applications.

### When to Use It
- **Data Fetching**: When you need to fetch data from an API when the component mounts.
- **Event Listeners**: When you need to set up event listeners or subscriptions that should be cleaned up when the component unmounts.

### Example
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const FetchDataComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
      setLoading(false);
    };

    fetchData();

    // Cleanup (if needed) can go here.
    return () => {
      // Example: Clean up subscriptions here
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs once on mount.

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Fetched Data:</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
};

export default FetchDataComponent;
```

### Explanation
- **Data Management**: The `useEffect` hook manages side effects like data fetching, ensuring that the data is fetched when the component mounts.
- **Cleanup Functionality**: The hook can also return a cleanup function, allowing you to unsubscribe or clean up resources when the component is removed from the UI.

By effectively using the `useEffect` hook, you can manage complex data flows and side effects in your React applications, leading to a better user experience and more maintainable code.
