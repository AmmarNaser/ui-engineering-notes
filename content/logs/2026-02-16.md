### State Management - Understanding React's useState Hook

In React, managing state is crucial for building interactive applications. The `useState` hook provides a way to handle state in functional components, allowing developers to create dynamic UIs.

### When to Use It
- **Single Value State**: Use `useState` when you need to manage a single piece of state, such as a boolean value for toggling or a numeric counter.
- **Form Inputs**: It's ideal for handling form input values where you want to track user input in real-time.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State Declaration**: The `useState` function initializes a state variable and a function to update it, in this case `count` and `setCount`.
- **Event Handling**: The event handler updates the state using the setter function, causing the component to re-render with the new state when the button is clicked.

Using `useState` allows for a straightforward and clean way to manage state in React components, improving both maintainability and readability.
