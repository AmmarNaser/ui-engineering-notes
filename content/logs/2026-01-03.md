# React Frontend Engineering Note

## Concept: Component Lifecycle Methods

Component lifecycle methods are special methods in a React component that are called at specific points during a component's lifetime. They allow developers to run code at particular stages like mounting, updating, and unmounting of the component.

## When to Use It

Lifecycle methods are essential when you need to perform side effects, such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or manually manipulating the DOM. They are primarily used in class components, but with the introduction of Hooks, similar functionality can now be achieved in functional components.

## Small Example

Here’s a simple example using a class component that demonstrates some lifecycle methods:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class Timer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { seconds: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Called after the component is mounted
    this.interval = setInterval(() => {
      this.setState(prevState => ({ seconds: prevState.seconds + 1 }));
    }, 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Cleanup before the component is removed from the DOM
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Timer: {this.state.seconds} seconds</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Timer;
```

In this example, `componentDidMount` is used to start a timer when the component mounts, and `componentWillUnmount` is used to clear the interval when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.

### Note

With the introduction of React Hooks, developers can achieve similar behavior using the `useEffect` Hook in functional components, making it easier to manage side effects without the complexity of class lifecycle methods.
