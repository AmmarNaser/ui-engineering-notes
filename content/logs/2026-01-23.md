React State Management - Understanding useState Hook

The `useState` hook is a fundamental React concept that allows functional components to manage local state. This hook enables developers to create interactive components with dynamic data, making it essential for building engaging user interfaces.

### When to Use It
- **Simple State Needs**: Use `useState` when you need to manage a small piece of state within a single component, such as form inputs or toggles.
- **Local Component Logic**: When your component has local logic that does not need to be shared with other components, `useState` is the ideal choice for tracking state.

### Example
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State Initialization**: The `useState` hook initializes the state variable (`count`) with a default value (0 in this case).
- **State Updater Function**: The second element returned from `useState` is a function to update the state (`setCount`). This function will trigger a re-render of the component when invoked.

The `useState` hook streamlines state management in functional components, enabling cleaner code and better performance in React applications.
