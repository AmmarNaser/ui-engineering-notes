### Custom Hooks - Simplifying State and Behavior Management in React

Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allows you to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic. By abstracting logic into a reusable function, you can enhance the maintainability and readability of your React components, leading to a more organized codebase.

### When to Use It
- **Component Logic Reuse**: When you have stateful logic that is needed in multiple components, creating a custom hook can help you avoid duplication and keep your components clean.
- **Encapsulating Side Effects**: Whenever a component requires shared side effects (like fetching data or managing subscriptions), a custom hook can help encapsulate and manage these effects independently.

### Example
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Custom Hook
function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
      setLoading(false);
    };
    
    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading };
}

// Using the Custom Hook in a Component
function DataFetchingComponent() {
  const { data, loading } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Fetched Data</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation
- **Reusability**: Custom hooks allow you to encapsulate logic that can be reused across multiple components, enabling better separation of concerns.
- **Cleaner Components**: By isolating logic into hooks, your individual components become simpler and more focused on rendering UI rather than managing state and side effects.

Using custom hooks can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your React applications, leading to a more efficient development process.
