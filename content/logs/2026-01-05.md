# React Frontend Engineering Note: Controlled Components

## Concept
Controlled components in React are form elements (like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`) whose values are controlled by the React state. This means that the state of the component is the single source of truth for the input value, and any changes to the input value will also update the state using an event handler.

## When to use it
Use controlled components when you need to manage the state of form inputs in a way that allows for validation, instant feedback, or when you want to synchronize the input value with other parts of your application. They are particularly useful in complex forms where the input values need to be derived from the application's state or when performing actions based on user input (like form submission or data fetching).

## Small Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledForm() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setInputValue(event.target.value); // Update state with input value
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(`A name was submitted: ${inputValue}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={inputValue} // Controlled input
          onChange={handleChange} // Handle input change
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default ControlledForm;
```

### Key Points
- The input's `value` is managed by React state (`inputValue`).
- The `onChange` handler updates the state with every keystroke.
- Form submission shows the current state value.

Controlled components ensure better control over the form data and offer enhanced capabilities for user input handling in React applications.
