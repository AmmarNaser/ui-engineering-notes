### React Hooks - Simplifying State Management

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They allow for a simpler and more concise way to manage state logic compared to class components, promoting better code organization and reusability.

### When to Use It
- **Stateful Logic**: When you need to manage local component state without converting your component to a class.
- **Side Effects**: When you need to perform data fetching or subscribe to external events, using `useEffect` helps handle these side effects elegantly.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1), 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(timer); // Cleanup on unmount
  }, []);

  return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

### Explanation
- **State Management**: The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components, making it easier to handle dynamic data.
- **Side Effects Handling**: The `useEffect` hook enables you to manage side effects, such as setting up timers or fetching data from APIs, while ensuring clean-up operations are handled correctly.

By utilizing React Hooks, you can create more functional and manageable components, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
