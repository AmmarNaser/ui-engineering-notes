### Hooks - The Power of React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They allow you to tap into the power of React functionalities in a functional component, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. Understanding Hooks is essential as they enhance component behavior and can simplify complex logic.

### When to Use It
- **State Management**: Utilize Hooks like `useState` to manage local state in functional components, simplifying component structure and removing the need for class-based components.
- **Side Effects**: Use `useEffect` to handle side effects, such as fetching data or subscribing to events, which allows you to manage lifecycle events in a more straightforward manner.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const FetchDataComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
      setLoading(false);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means it runs once when component mounts

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default FetchDataComponent;
```

### Explanation
- **State Management with useState**: The `useState` Hook allows you to declare state variables in functional components, making it easier to manage and update component state.
- **Side Effects with useEffect**: The `useEffect` Hook is a powerful tool for executing side effects like data fetching and subscribing/unsubscribing from events. It helps manage the component's behavior related to lifecycle events.

In summary, React Hooks bring simplicity and clarity to functional components, enhancing state management and lifecycle handling.
