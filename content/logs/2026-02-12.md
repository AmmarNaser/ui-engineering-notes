### Controlled Components - Managing Form State in React

Controlled components are a key concept in React form handling. They allow React to fully control the form data, ensuring that all input values are stored in the React state.

### What are Controlled Components?
Controlled components are React components that do not maintain their own state for form inputs. Instead, their state is controlled by React, making it easier to manage the input values and perform validations. By binding the input value to the component's state, any changes to the input will be reflected in the component’s state, providing a single source of truth. This approach simplifies the process of handling form submissions and validations, allowing developers to more easily manage complex forms.

### When to Use It
- **Simple Forms**: When you have simple forms where inputs do not need to manage complex states.
- **Dynamic Forms**: In scenarios where forms change dynamically, controlled components make it easier to manage and validate the current input states.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ControlledForm = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(`Submitted Name: ${name}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={name} 
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} 
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default ControlledForm;
```

### Explanation
- **Single Source of Truth**: The input value is derived from the component’s state, ensuring that any changes are captured immediately.
- **Validation and Handling**: Controlled components allow for easy validation and on-the-fly adjustments to input values based on user interaction or other component states.

Controlled components provide a more predictable and manageable approach to handling forms in React applications. By centralizing the input state, they simplify the complexity often associated with form handling.
