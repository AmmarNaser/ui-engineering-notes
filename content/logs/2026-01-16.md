### Component Lifecycle Methods - Understanding React's Lifecycle Hooks

In React, lifecycle methods are special functions that allow developers to run code at specific points in a component's life. These methods help manage side effects, data fetching, and other operations that need to occur based on the component's lifecycle state.

### When to Use It
- **Component Mounting**: Use lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` to fetch data after a component has been rendered for the first time.
- **Component Updating**: Employ `componentDidUpdate` to execute code in response to prop or state changes, allowing for operations that depend on the updated data.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class UserProfile extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      user: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch user data after the component mounts
    fetch(`https://api.example.com/user/${this.props.userId}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ user: data }));
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    // Fetch new user data if the userId prop changes
    if (this.props.userId !== prevProps.userId) {
      fetch(`https://api.example.com/user/${this.props.userId}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => this.setState({ user: data }));
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { user } = this.state;
    return user ? (
      <div>
        <h1>{user.name}</h1>
        <p>{user.email}</p>
      </div>
    ) : (
      <p>Loading...</p>
    );
  }
}

export default UserProfile;
```

### Explanation
- **Mounting and Updating**: The `componentDidMount` method is triggered once when the component mounts, making it ideal for data-fetching. `componentDidUpdate` runs after every render, allowing for updates based on prop changes.
- **State Management**: Using state within lifecycle methods ensures that the UI reflects the current data accurately, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience.

Understanding and utilizing lifecycle methods is crucial for managing side effects in React applications effectively.
