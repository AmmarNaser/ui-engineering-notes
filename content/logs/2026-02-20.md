### React Hooks - Managing Component State with useState

React Hooks provide a powerful way to manage state and lifecycle methods in functional components. The `useState` hook is one of the most commonly used hooks, allowing you to add state to functional components easily.

### When to Use It
- **Handling User Input**: Use `useState` when you need to manage the state of user input, such as form fields, selections, or any interactive components.
- **Toggling UI Elements**: Utilize `useState` to manage the visibility of certain UI elements, such as dropdowns, modals, or conditional rendering of components.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State Initialization**: The `useState` hook takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array containing the current state and a function to update it.
- **Reactivity**: Any updates to the state using the updater function will cause a re-render of the component, ensuring the UI reflects the current state.

Using `useState` simplifies state management in functional components, making your React code cleaner and more understandable.
