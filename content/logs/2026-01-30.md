### React Hooks - Managing State with useState

React Hooks, specifically the `useState` hook, allow functional components to manage local state without the need for class components. This feature enhances code readability and reusability, making it easier to develop modern React applications.

### When to Use It
- **State Management in Functional Components**: Use `useState` when you need to manage local state within a functional component, such as form inputs or toggles.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Opt for `useState` when building components that require UI to react to user interactions, like changing a theme or updating a list.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State Initialization**: The `useState` hook initializes the state variable (`count`) to 0, and provides a function (`setCount`) to update it.
- **Re-rendering on State Change**: Every time `setCount` is called, the component re-renders to reflect the new state, ensuring the UI remains in sync with user actions.

This fundamental concept of using `useState` is a cornerstone for building interactive React applications efficiently.
