### State Management - Understanding React's useState Hook

React's `useState` hook is a fundamental concept for managing state in functional components. It provides a way for components to maintain and update local state dynamically as user interactions occur.

### When to Use It
- **Basic State Management**: Use `useState` when you want to handle simple state variables such as form inputs, toggles, or counters within a single component.
- **Component-Level State**: It is ideal for scenarios where the state does not need to be shared across multiple components, allowing for a localized state management approach.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initialize state

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State Initialization**: The `useState` hook is called with an initial value (0 in this case), which sets up the `count` state variable.
- **Updating State**: The `setCount` function updates the state. React re-renders the component when the state changes, reflecting the updated value.

By using `useState`, developers can create interactive components that respond to user actions and manage their internal state efficiently.
