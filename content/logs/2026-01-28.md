### Custom Hooks - Simplifying State Logic in React
Custom hooks are a way to extract component logic into reusable functions in React, allowing for cleaner code and better state management across multiple components.

### What is a Custom Hook?
A custom hook is a function in React that follows the naming convention of starting with "use" and can call other hooks within it. It enables you to extract and reuse stateful logic without changing the component hierarchy. This is particularly useful when your component relies on the same stateful logic or effects in various parts of your application, promoting reusability and reducing duplication.

### When to Use It
- **Shared Logic**: When multiple components share the same stateful logic, creating a custom hook allows you to encapsulate that logic in one place.
- **Complex State Management**: When your component's logic becomes too complex or unwieldy, extracting parts of it into a custom hook can simplify your component and make it easier to understand and maintain.

### Example
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Custom Hook
function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
      setLoading(false);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading };
}

// Component using the Custom Hook
function DisplayData({ apiUrl }) {
  const { data, loading } = useFetch(apiUrl);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data:</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation
- **Reusability**: Custom hooks allow you to encapsulate logic that can be reused across different components, which leads to cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By isolating the logic associated with fetching data, you maintain separation between UI concerns and business logic, thus improving code organization.

Using custom hooks can significantly enhance the scalability of your React applications by promoting cleaner architecture and easier maintenance.
