### Controlled Components - Managing Form Data in React

Controlled components are React components that manage their own state through React's state management system, making it easier to handle user input and form submissions. In a controlled component, form data is handled by the state of the component, offering a clear way to access and update data.

### When to Use It
- **User Input Forms**: When building forms where you need to validate user input, a controlled component streamlines data handling by keeping the input values in sync with the component's state.
- **Dynamic Form Fields**: In scenarios where the form fields change dynamically based on user actions (e.g., adding/removing fields), controlled components make it easier to manage the state of each field.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setName(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(`A name was submitted: ${name}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default ControlledForm;
```

### Explanation
- **State Synchronization**: The value of the input field is controlled by the component's state (`name`), ensuring that the UI reflects the latest state and vice versa.
- **Event Handling**: The `onChange` event is used to update the state whenever the user types in the input, providing a seamless user experience.

Controlled components provide a reliable method for managing form data in React applications, ensuring both consistency and control.
