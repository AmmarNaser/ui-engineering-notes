# React Frontend Engineering Note

## Concept: React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks enable functional components to manage state, lifecycle methods, and other capabilities previously only available in class components.

## When to Use It

Use React Hooks when:
- You want to manage component state and lifecycle events in functional components.
- You prefer a cleaner and more concise way to structure your components.
- You want to share stateful logic between components without using higher-order components or render props.

## Small Example

Here's a simple example using the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to create a counter component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
    }, [count]);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation

- **useState:** Initializes a state variable `count` with a default value of `0` and provides a function `setCount` to update it.
- **useEffect:** Updates the document title whenever `count` changes, mimicking the behavior of lifecycle methods in class components.

By using hooks, the above functional component remains compact and easy to understand.
