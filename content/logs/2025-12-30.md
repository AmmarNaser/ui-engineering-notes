# React Frontend Engineering Note: Controlled Components

## Concept
Controlled components in React are form elements whose values are controlled by the state of a React component. In a controlled component, the form data is handled by the React component rather than the DOM. This means that the input value is kept in the component's state, and every change to the input updates the state.

## When to Use It
- When you need to manage form data in a structured way, especially when the form has multiple inputs that depend on each other.
- When you require validation to be implemented based on the input's value.
- When you wish to trigger side effects (like API calls) based on user input.

## Small Example
Here's a simple example of a controlled component using a text input field:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ControlledInput = () => {
  // State to hold the input value
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  // Function to handle input change
  const handleInputChange = (event) => {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={inputValue}  // Controlled by React state
          onChange={handleInputChange}  // Updates state on change
        />
      </label>
      <p>Your input: {inputValue}</p>  {/* Displays the current input value */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ControlledInput;
```

In this code:
- `inputValue` holds the state of the input field.
- `handleInputChange` updates the state whenever the user types in the input field.
- The input field's `value` is set to `inputValue`, ensuring it reflects the component's state.
