### React Hooks - Simplifying State Management

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a more concise and intuitive way to manage state and lifecycle events, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

### When to Use It
- **State Management**: Use hooks like `useState` and `useReducer` when you need to handle component state without converting functional components to class components.
- **Side Effects**: Use the `useEffect` hook for managing side effects such as fetching data or subscribing to events in a clean and organized manner.

### Example
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

### Explanation
- **useState Hook**: This hook allows you to add state to functional components, making it possible to track and update values within the component.
- **useEffect Hook**: It enables you to perform side effects in your components, such as data fetching or modifying the DOM, and it manages the dependencies to optimize performance.

Incorporating React Hooks into your components can significantly improve the structure and efficiency of your code, making it easier to read and maintain.
