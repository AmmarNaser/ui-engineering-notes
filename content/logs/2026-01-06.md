# React Frontend Engineering Note: Functional Components

## Concept
Functional components are a fundamental building block in React used for creating UI components. They are JavaScript functions that return React elements. Unlike class components, functional components do not have their own state or lifecycle methods, but they can use hooks to manage state and side effects.

## When to Use It
- **Simplicity**: When you need a component that is straightforward and does not require lifecycle methods.
- **Performance**: Functional components can be more performant, especially when using React.memo for memoization.
- **Hooks**: When you want to utilize state and side effects without converting your component to a class component.
- **Stateless UI**: Ideal for presentational components that render UI based on props without internal state management.

## Small Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  // Declare a state variable 'count' and a function 'setCount' to update it
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

In this example, the `Counter` component is a functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage the count state. It increments the count each time the button is clicked and displays the current count.
