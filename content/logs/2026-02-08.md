### Component Composition - Building Reusable UI Components

Component composition is a fundamental concept in React that allows developers to combine multiple components to create complex UIs. This approach promotes reusability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns within your application.

### When to Use It
- **Creating Complex UIs**: When you need to build a UI that consists of multiple functional areas, composing smaller, reusable components is a great strategy to keep your code organized.
- **Sharing Functionality**: When you have common features or functionalities across different parts of your application, composing components can streamline updates and reduce redundancy.

### Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Button component
const Button = ({ label, onClick }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
);

// Card component
const Card = ({ title, content, onButtonClick }) => (
  <div className="card">
    <h2>{title}</h2>
    <p>{content}</p>
    <Button label="Click Me" onClick={onButtonClick} />
  </div>
);

// App component
const App = () => {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <Card
        title="My Card Title"
        content="Some interesting content here."
        onButtonClick={handleButtonClick}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Explanation
- **Reusable Components**: The `Button` and `Card` components can be reused throughout the application, enhancing consistency and reducing code duplication.
- **Prop Drilling**: The `Card` component takes in a function as a prop and passes it to the `Button`, demonstrating how you can manage events and interactions across composed components.

By leveraging component composition in React, developers can create flexible and maintainable UI architectures that stand the test of time.
