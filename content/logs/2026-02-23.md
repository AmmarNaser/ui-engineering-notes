### Custom Hooks - Reusable Logic in React

Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow developers to extract stateful logic and reuse it across components. They help keep your components clean and focused on rendering by abstracting away complex logic into isolated functions.

### When to Use It
- **Fetching Data**: When you need to access an API from multiple components, a custom hook can encapsulate the logic for data fetching and state management.
- **Form Handling**: If you have several forms using similar validation and input handling, a custom hook can simplify that functionality and reduce duplication.

### Example
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Custom Hook for Data Fetching
const useFetch = (url) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        }
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
};

// Usage in a Component
const DataDisplay = ({ apiUrl }) => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch(apiUrl);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  return <div>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
};
```

### Explanation
- **Encapsulation of Logic**: Custom hooks allow for the separation of functionality related to state management and side effects, promoting cleaner component design.
- **Reusability**: Once created, a custom hook can be utilized across different components, significantly reducing code duplication and enhancing maintainability.

Custom hooks are an effective way to manage shared logic in your React applications while keeping components focused and organized.
