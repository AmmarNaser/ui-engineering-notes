### React Hooks - Managing State with useState

React Hooks are a powerful feature that allows developers to use state and other React features without writing a class. Among these hooks, `useState` is one of the most commonly used, enabling functional components to manage local state in a simple and effective manner.

### When to Use It
- **Basic State Management**: Utilize `useState` when you need to manage simple state variables, such as form inputs or toggle switches.
- **Component Re-renders**: Use `useState` to trigger component re-renders when state changes, ensuring the UI reflects the latest data.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrease</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State Initialization**: The `useState` hook lets you declare state variables. In the example, `count` is initialized to `0`.
- **State Update Function**: `setCount` is a function used to update the value of `count`. Calls to it will queue a re-render of the component, reflecting changes in the UI.

By employing `useState`, developers can write cleaner and more functional React components without relying on class-based components.
