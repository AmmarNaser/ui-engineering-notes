### State Management - Understanding React's useState Hook

React's useState hook is a fundamental concept in functional components, allowing developers to manage state easily and efficiently. By using this hook, you can add state to functional components, providing a way to handle dynamic data and user interactions.

### When to Use It
- **Component State**: Use useState when you need to store and update a local state in a functional component, such as form inputs or toggling elements.
- **Dynamic Data**: Use useState when your component needs to reflect changes based on user actions or asynchronous data fetching, like response handling from APIs.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **Initial State**: The state is initialized by calling useState with a default value (e.g., `useState(0)` initializes `count` to 0).
- **State Updater**: The `setCount` function updates the state; it can accept a new value or a function that returns the new value based on the previous state.

By effectively utilizing the useState hook, you can create responsive and interactive components that enhance user experience.
