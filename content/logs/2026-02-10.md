### Component Lifecycle - Understanding React Component Lifecycle Methods

In React, component lifecycle methods are hooks that allow developers to run code at specific points in a component's life. These methods are crucial for managing side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, and more, making them foundational for effective React applications.

### When to Use It
- **Component Initialization**: Use lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` to perform actions after a component is mounted, such as fetching data from an API.
- **Component Updates**: Leverage `componentDidUpdate` to respond to state or prop changes, allowing for logic that should occur after the component rerenders.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class DataFetcher extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetching data when the component is mounted
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    // Respond to props change
    if (this.props.userId !== prevProps.userId) {
      this.fetchUserData(this.props.userId);
    }
  }

  fetchUserData(userId) {
    fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    const { data } = this.state;
    return (
      <div>
        {data ? <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre> : 'Loading...'}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default DataFetcher;
```

### Explanation
- **Lifecycle Methods**: `componentDidMount` is called once the component is mounted, ideal for side effects like API calls. `componentDidUpdate` checks for changes in props to trigger further updates.
- **State Management**: The component maintains its state using `this.state`, allowing React to efficiently re-render only parts of the UI that change when new data is fetched.

Understanding and leveraging component lifecycle methods can significantly enhance the performance and behavior of your React applications, particularly when dealing with asynchronous data and user interactions.
