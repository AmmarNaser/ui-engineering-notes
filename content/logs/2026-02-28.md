### React Hooks - Simplifying State Management and Side Effects

React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and side effects in a more concise and declarative way compared to class components. Introduced in React 16.8, hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` empower developers to write cleaner and more modular code, making the component logic easier to understand and maintain.

### When to Use It
- **State Management**: Use hooks to manage local component state in functional components, replacing the need for class-based state management.
- **Side Effects**: Use `useEffect` to perform side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations in a controlled manner without lifecycle methods.

### Example
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;

    return () => {
      // Cleanup if necessary
    };
  }, [count]); // This effect runs when 'count' changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

### Explanation
- **State Management**: The `useState` hook initializes the `count` state variable, which can be updated with the `setCount` function.
- **Side Effects**: The `useEffect` hook allows us to update the document title whenever the `count` state changes, demonstrating how to handle side effects based on state changes.

Using React Hooks enhances code readability and encourages functional programming patterns in React applications.
