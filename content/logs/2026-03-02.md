### useEffect - Managing Side Effects in React

The `useEffect` hook is a fundamental part of modern React development, enabling developers to handle side effects in function components seamlessly. It allows you to perform actions like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM after rendering.

### When to Use It
- **Data Fetching**: When you need to fetch data from an API after your component has mounted.
- **Event Listening**: When you want to set up event listeners that should be added when a component mounts and cleaned up when it unmounts.

### Example
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetchingComponent = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
            const result = await response.json();
            setData(result);
            setLoading(false);
        };

        fetchData();
    }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this runs once on mount

    if (loading) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    return (
        <ul>
            {data.map(item => (
                <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
};

export default DataFetchingComponent;
```

### Explanation
- **Side Effects**: `useEffect` allows you to incorporate side effects, making it perfect for operations like data fetching or subscriptions without affecting the component's render cycle.
- **Cleanup Function**: It can return a cleanup function to prevent memory leaks by cleaning up after effects, such as removing event listeners or canceling network requests when the component unmounts.

Using `useEffect` effectively can greatly enhance performance and ensure your components behave as expected in response to changes in state or props.
