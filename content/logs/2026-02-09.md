### Component Lifecycle - Understanding React Component Lifecycle Methods

In React, component lifecycle methods provide hooks into specific points in a component's life. Understanding these methods is crucial for managing component behavior, especially in scenarios involving data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulation.

### When to Use It
- **Data Fetching**: Use lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` to initiate network requests after a component mounts.
- **Subscription Management**: Use `componentDidMount` to set up subscriptions and `componentWillUnmount` to clean them up, preventing memory leaks.

### Example
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ExampleComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetching data when the component mounts
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Cleanup logic if you set up subscriptions
    // this.unsubscribe();
  }

  render() {
    const { data } = this.state;
    return (
      <div>
        {data ? <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre> : <p>Loading...</p>}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```

### Explanation
- **componentDidMount**: This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted, making it ideal for initiating side effects like data fetching.
- **componentWillUnmount**: This method is called immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed, useful for cleaning up subscriptions or event listeners to prevent memory leaks.

Understanding and properly utilizing component lifecycle methods can greatly improve the performance and reliability of your React applications.
