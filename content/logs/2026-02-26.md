### Component Lifecycle Methods - Understanding React's Lifecycle Phases

React components go through a series of phases during their existence, known as lifecycle phases. Understanding these lifecycle methods is crucial for effectively managing component behavior in response to state changes, props updates, and component unmounting.

### When to Use It
- **Initial Render**: Utilize lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` to execute code after a component mounts, such as fetching data.
- **State Updates**: Use `componentDidUpdate` to respond to prop or state changes, allowing you to perform operations after a component updates.

### Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch data when the component mounts
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    // Respond to changes in props
    if (this.props.someValue !== prevProps.someValue) {
      console.log('Props changed! New value:', this.props.someValue);
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My Data</h1>
        {this.state.data ? <p>{this.state.data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Explanation
- **Key Point**: The `componentDidMount` method is called once immediately after a component is mounted, which is ideal for data fetching.
- **Another Point**: The `componentDidUpdate` method is invoked immediately after updating occurs, allowing you to handle updates based on the previous and current props/states.

Understanding these lifecycle methods can greatly enhance the way you interact with components, ensuring they perform optimally throughout their lifecycle.
