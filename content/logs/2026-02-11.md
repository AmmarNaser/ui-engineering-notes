React Hooks - Leveraging State and Lifecycle in Functional Components

React Hooks are a revolutionary feature that allows you to use state and other React features in functional components. This shifts the paradigm from class-based components, enabling simpler and more reusable code while embracing the functional programming style.

### When to Use It
- **State Management**: Use hooks when you need to manage local state within a functional component without converting it to a class.
- **Side Effects**: They are ideal for managing side effects, such as fetching data or subscriptions in a functional component, using the `useEffect` hook.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- **State with `useState`**: The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components, making it easier to manage component-specific data.
- **Side Effects with `useEffect`**: The `useEffect` hook enables you to perform side effects in function components, such as updating the document title or fetching data from an API.

React Hooks simplify the way components handle state and lifecycle events, resulting in more concise and maintainable code.
