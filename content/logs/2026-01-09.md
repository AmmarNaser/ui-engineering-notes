# React Frontend Engineering Note: Custom Hooks

## Concept
Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow developers to extract and reuse stateful logic across components. They are JavaScript functions that can utilize built-in hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, or any other hooks, to manage stateful behavior in a clean and reusable way.

## When to Use It
Use custom hooks when:
- You need to share complex logic between multiple components.
- Your components become cluttered with repetitive code for similar functionalities.
- You want to abstract away logic into a more manageable and testable piece of code.

## Small Example
Let's create a simple custom hook called `useCounter`. This hook will provide state and functions to manage a counter value.

```javascript
// useCounter.js
import { useState } from 'react';

const useCounter = (initialValue = 0) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

    const increment = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    const decrement = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1);
    const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);

    return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
};

export default useCounter;
```

Now you can use this custom hook in any functional component.

```javascript
// CounterComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import useCounter from './useCounter';

const CounterComponent = () => {
    const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = useCounter(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
            <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default CounterComponent;
```

## Conclusion
Custom hooks in React are a great way to encapsulate logic and state management for your components. By following the example above, you can easily share, manage, and maintain code, making your React application cleaner and more efficient.
