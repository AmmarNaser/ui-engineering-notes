# React Frontend Engineering Note

## Concept: Component Lifecycle Methods

In React, component lifecycle methods are special methods in a component's class that allow you to run code at specific times in a component's life. These methods are particularly useful for handling side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, and manual DOM manipulations.

## When to Use It

Use component lifecycle methods when you need to execute code at specific points during a component's lifetime, such as:

- **Initialization**: Set initial state or fetch data before the component mounts.
- **Updating**: Respond to changes in props or state.
- **Unmounting**: Clean up resources, such as canceling subscriptions or clearing timers to avoid memory leaks.

Note: With the introduction of React hooks, many developers now favor functional components and hooks (e.g., `useEffect`) for handling side effects.

## Small Example

Here's a simple example using a class component to demonstrate lifecycle methods. The component fetches and displays user data when it mounts.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class UserProfile extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      user: null,
      isLoading: true,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch user data when the component mounts
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ user: data, isLoading: false }))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching user:', error));
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Cleanup if needed (e.g., cancel subscriptions)
    console.log('UserProfile component is being removed from the DOM');
  }

  render() {
    const { user, isLoading } = this.state;

    if (isLoading) {
      return <p>Loading...</p>;
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{user.name}</h1>
        <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default UserProfile;
```

In this example:
- `componentDidMount()` is used to fetch user data from an API when the component first mounts.
- `componentWillUnmount()` provides a place for any necessary cleanup logic.
- The component updates its state and re-renders when the data is fetched.
