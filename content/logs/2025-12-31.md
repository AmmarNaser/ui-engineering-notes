# React Frontend Engineering Note

## Concept: Component Lifecycle Methods

React Component Lifecycle Methods are special methods that automatically get called at specific points in a component's life. These methods allow developers to run code at specific times in a component's existence, providing hooks to perform actions like fetching data, interacting with external APIs, or cleaning up resources.

## When to Use It

Component lifecycle methods are particularly useful when you need to:
- Fetch data from an API when the component mounts.
- Perform some setup actions before the component appears.
- Clean up subscriptions, timers, or event listeners when the component unmounts.
- Respond to updates in props or state to perform side effects.

## Small Example

Here's a simple example using class components to illustrate some lifecycle methods:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class DataFetcher extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
      loading: true,
    };
  }

  // componentDidMount is called after the component is mounted
  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        this.setState({ data, loading: false });
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        this.setState({ loading: false });
      });
  }

  // componentWillUnmount is called just before the component is unmounted
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Cleanup actions can be performed here (e.g., cancel network requests)
  }

  render() {
    const { loading, data } = this.state;

    if (loading) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Fetched Data</h1>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default DataFetcher;
```

In this example, `componentDidMount` fetches data from an API when the component is first rendered, setting the state with the retrieved data. The `componentWillUnmount` method is included to show where cleanup logic could go, even though it's not used here.

## Conclusion

Understanding and utilizing Component Lifecycle Methods is crucial for managing side effects in React applications. With React's transition to functional components and hooks, similar functionality is available with hooks like `useEffect`, but class components still provide a solid foundation in understanding how components operate over their lifecycle.
