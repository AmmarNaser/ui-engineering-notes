### Custom Hooks - Simplifying Reusable Logic in React

Custom Hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow developers to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic in a clean and organized manner. They help to keep components streamlined and promote code reuse, making complex components easier to manage and understand.

### When to Use It
- **Stateful Logic**: Use custom hooks when you have stateful logic that needs to be reused across multiple components, such as fetching data or managing form inputs.
- **Component Complexity**: Employ custom hooks to break down complex components into simpler, more manageable pieces, thereby enhancing readability and maintainability.

### Example
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Custom Hook for fetching data
function useFetch(url) {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            try {
                const response = await fetch(url);
                if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                const result = await response.json();
                setData(result);
            } catch (err) {
                setError(err);
            } finally {
                setLoading(false);
            }
        };

        fetchData();
    }, [url]);

    return { data, loading, error };
}

// Usage in a component
function DataDisplayComponent() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');

    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

    return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Reusability**: Custom hooks allow you to write reusable code blocks that can be shared across different components, reducing duplication.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By using custom hooks, you separate logic from UI, making it easier to manage and test the functionalities without affecting the component structure.

Custom hooks are an essential part of building scalable and maintainable React applications. They promote clean code practices and enhance the developer experience by allowing for easier logic sharing.
