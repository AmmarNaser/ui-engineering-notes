# React Frontend Engineering Note

## Concept
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). It allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, which can lead to more maintainable and scalable applications.

## When to Use It
- When building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- When the project requires a component-based architecture for better code organization and reusability.
- When managing the state across various components becomes complex, making a unidirectional data flow beneficial.
- For projects that need to optimize performance through techniques like virtual DOM.

## Small Example

Here's a simple example of a functional component in React that maintains its own state using hooks:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  // Declare a state variable "count" and a function to update it
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
- `useState` is a Hook that lets you add state to your functional components. In the example, `count` is a state variable, and `setCount` is the function to update it.
- When the button is clicked, `setCount` is called to increment the count, which triggers a re-render of the component with the updated count displayed. 

This pattern demonstrates how to create interactive components in React effectively.
