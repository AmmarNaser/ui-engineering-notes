# React Frontend Engineering Note: Controlled Components

## Concept
Controlled components in React refer to components that manage their state through props. In this model, form elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` do not maintain their own internal state. Instead, their values are driven by React state, which means that any changes to the form elements must be handled through React's state management.

## When to Use It
Controlled components are useful when:
- You need to synchronize the form input with the React state.
- You want to impose validation rules or handle dynamic computations based on the input values.
- You wish to ensure that the UI accurately reflects the form values at all times, especially with complex or interrelated state logic.

## Small Example
Here’s a simple example demonstrating a controlled input component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ControlledInput = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(`Submitted value: ${inputValue}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Input:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={inputValue}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default ControlledInput;
```

### Explanation
In the example above:
- The `inputValue` state is initialized with an empty string.
- The `handleChange` function updates the React state whenever the input changes.
- On form submission, the current state value is alerted, demonstrating controlled behavior.

This approach ensures that the component’s rendering is always in sync with the input value, providing a straightforward way to handle form inputs and their states in a predictable manner.
