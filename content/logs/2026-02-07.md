### Custom Hooks - Reusable Logic in React

Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow developers to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components. By creating custom hooks, you can keep your components cleaner and more focused on rendering, while moving complex logic into dedicated functions.

### When to Use It
- **State Management**: When you need to share similar stateful logic between multiple components, creating a custom hook can simplify your code and enhance maintainability.
- **Side Effects**: If multiple components require the same side effects, such as fetching data or subscribing to a service, a custom hook can handle the common logic effectively.

### Example
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFetch(url) {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            try {
                const response = await fetch(url);
                if (!response.ok) {
                    throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                }
                const result = await response.json();
                setData(result);
            } catch (error) {
                setError(error);
            } finally {
                setLoading(false);
            }
        };
        fetchData();
    }, [url]);

    return { data, loading, error };
}

// Usage Example
const MyComponent = () => {
    const { data, loading, error } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');

    if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
    if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Data:</h1>
            <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Explanation
- **Encapsulation**: Custom hooks allow you to encapsulate logic that can be shared between components, promoting reusability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By moving logic out of components and into hooks, you maintain a clearer separation between UI rendering and business logic, making components easier to manage and test.

Custom hooks are a great way to increase the modularity of your React applications, ensuring that your components remain focused and your stateful logic is reusable.
