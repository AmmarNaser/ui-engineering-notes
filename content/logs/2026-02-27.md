### Custom Hooks - Streamlining State Management in React

Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow developers to extract and reuse stateful logic across components. By encapsulating common logic in a hook, you can keep your components cleaner and enhance code reusability.

### When to Use It
- **Shared Logic**: When you have stateful logic that needs to be used in multiple components, creating a custom hook can help keep your components DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- **Complex State Management**: For managing complex pieces of state, such as form inputs or data fetching, a custom hook can simplify the component's logic.

### Example
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    
    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}

// Usage in a component
function App() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Custom hooks let you separate your data-fetching logic from your UI logic, making components easier to read and maintain.
- **Reusable Logic**: Once defined, a custom hook can be reused across any component, making it easier to handle similar functionalities consistently throughout your application.

By leveraging custom hooks, you can improve code organization and facilitate better management of shared logic in your React applications.
