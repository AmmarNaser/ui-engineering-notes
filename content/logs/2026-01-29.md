### React Hooks - Simplifying State Management

React Hooks are a revolutionary addition to React that allow developers to manage state and side effects in functional components. They provide a more intuitive and cleaner way to work with state without the need for class components, making your code more readable and maintainable.

### When to Use It
- **State Management**: Use hooks when you need to track and manage state in your functional components instead of using class components.
- **Side Effects**: Utilize hooks for managing side effects (like data fetching) in your components, making it easier to handle lifecycle events.

### Example
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

### Explanation
- **useState**: This hook allows you to add state to your functional components. In the example, `count` is the state variable, and `setCount` is the function to update it.
- **useEffect**: This hook lets you perform side effects in your components. Here, it updates the document title whenever `count` changes.

React Hooks greatly enhance the functionality of functional components, making state and lifecycle management seamless and efficient.
